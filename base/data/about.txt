This site is a showcase of the Python projects I've done. My goal is to build useful tools for people working in Support roles.

## AI Statement:

This site has been written the old-fashioned way - by hand. No vibe coding was used. If you want proof, check out the project history on Github.

There *were* instances where I couldn't figure out how to accomplish a specific thing, so I'd ask AI to tell me ways of doing that. In the old days I might have used Ye Olde Searche Engine to find forums with coding Q&A, but SEO makes them useless nowadays, so AI is pretty good at offering possible ways to code a specific thing.

I am wary of vibe coding:

- [AI Code Hallucinations Increase the Risk of "Package Confusion" Attacks](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-code-hallucinations-increase-the-risk-of-package-confusion-attacks/)
- [Vibe Coding Is the New Open Source - in the Worst Way Possible](https://www.wired.com/story/vibe-coding-is-the-new-open-source/)
- [Study finds AI tools made open source software developers 19 percent slower](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/study-finds-ai-tools-made-open-source-software-developers-19-percent-slower/)

The real risk of vibe coding is that you don't *really* know what the code is doing, or why it's doing what it's doing. After all, the point of vibe coding is to ***not*** write the code yourself.

I'm more interested in learning how to write code that does useful things.
