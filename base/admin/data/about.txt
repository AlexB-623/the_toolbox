##Admin Panel

There's a handful of functions I need to be able to execute on-demand to ensure the site is usable. These have consequences, so I needed to be able to restrict access to specific users.

Adding an admin panel seemed like the next logical step.

This page checks for any URL on the site that is decorated with the @admin_required decorator, then lists it here.

If you're not an admin, you won't be able to use these, but the names should give you a sense of what they do.
