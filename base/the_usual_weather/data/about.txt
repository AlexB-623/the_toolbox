##About this module:

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results...

But it *can* be an indication.

Take the weather, for example. Without looking at historical records, you probably know *approximately* what temperature it will be in your home area at any given point in the year. You know what is "typical" for that time of the year.

But what if you're trying to plan a vacation 6 months out? It becomes a bit more complicated if you don't know the typical temperatures for the area you want to visit.

I built this tool to try to guess what "The Usual Weather" is at any given time of the year in any particular location based on the typical temperatures for the location over the past few decades.

The tool works like this:

- Input:
    - location (city name)
    - date (month & day)
- The tool takes the input and:
    - attempts to look up GPS coordinates for the city name
    - generates a list of dates (mm/dd/yyyy) for all days 1 week before and 1 week after the given date, and for every year going back to 1980
- Once the tool has the GPS coordinates and the dates, it calls the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API to get the weather record for the location and dates
- The API response is collated as a PANDAS dataframe (i.e. like an Excel spreadsheet)
- The PANDAS dataframe is then analyzed to tell you, from the past ~45 years, what is "The Usual Weather" for the 2 weeks around that date for in that location.

## Why write all this code for something you could ask AI and get an answer in ~30 seconds?

Answer: I wanted to see if I could do it myself.
